# Personal Knowledge Wiki

This project is a personal wiki where I document and consolidate the core concepts I want to truly understand. The goal is to explain fundamentals with short, focused notes written in Markdown.

## Topics

- Linux - processes, permissions, filesystem, init systems, cgroups, namespaces...
- Bash & Shell Scripting - command flow, subshells, quoting, pipelines, debugging...
- Networking - TCP/IP basics, routing, DNS, load balancing, firewalls...

## Additional Areas to Add

- Containers & Kubernetes - namespaces, cgroups, OCI, container lifecycle, kube architecture.
- Operating Systems Fundamentals - memory, scheduling, interrupts, syscalls.
- Protocols & Distributed Systems - RPC, REST/gRPC, consensus basics, message queues.
- Cloud & Infrastructure - virtualization, storage, IAM, Terraform fundamentals.
- Observability - logging, metrics, tracing, tooling.
- Security basics - encryption, certificates, threat models, least privilege.

## Roadmap

1. Start with short, atomic notes - 1 concept == 1 file.
2. Grow each topic by focusing on fundamentals before tools.
3. Revisit and refine explanations as understanding improves.
4. Add diagrams or examples only when they help clarify.
5. Keep everything simple, direct, and practical.
